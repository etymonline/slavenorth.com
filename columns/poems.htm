 <H3>FOUR SONNETS</H3>

        <P><B>I.</B>
<BR>
<BR>You men who take a woman’s measure
<BR>By girth of breast or tint of hair
<BR>Weigh but your own bland pleasure
<BR>Like judges of the county fair.
<BR>You are fools, never to note
<BR>The quick smiles my beloved flashes
<BR>Or the flicker of tendons on her throat
<BR>As she lifts her splendid head and splashes
<BR>A room with laughter, or a tear
<BR>Battened behind an eye’s defense
<BR>Too proud to show the secret fear;
<BR>How useless are those measurements
<BR>To miss a beauty plain and pure
<BR>That tangles more tightly than mere allure.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>II.</B>
<BR>
<BR>How strange that back to back we stand,
<BR>You searching for love’s distant sail
<BR>And cloud-cleaving high embrace
<BR>From a self-possessing, steady man
<BR>While earthen suitors trip and fail
<BR>And smirk through courtship’s painted face.
<BR>And I, near enough to touch,
<BR>Crouch in self-denying bands
<BR>And dream your eyes and yet forbear
<BR>To sing the name I love so much
<BR>Or turn and slip my pinioned hands
<BR>Around your waist and rise through air.
<BR>You long for wild wings to fly
<BR>I break my feathers and deny, deny.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>III.</B>
<BR>
<BR>Your lovely girlfriend, wise and amorous,
<BR>Fixed me in her casual stare
<BR>And asked me, wouldn’t you look glamorous
<BR>In silken gowns and flowing hair?
<BR>A surge of panic seized my brain:
<BR>What should I say, That I desired
<BR>You as a city street, summer-fired
<BR>Desires rain?
<BR>That the wicked laughing gleams
<BR>In your eyes, and your throat swan-white
<BR>Swam in my dreams again last night,
<BR>That your hair was the silk of my dreams?
<BR>I said nothing, and in my shame
<BR>She heard my heart that beat your name.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>IV.</B>
<BR>
<BR>I will be all men to you -- no,
<BR>Not just King Arthur and Valentino
<BR>But the coarse-fingered boy who
<BR>Fumbled your first love, then flew,
<BR>And all who made you cynical and wise
<BR>To fickle men and their urgent lies,
<BR>To ego-pups who lick their pleasures first;
<BR>I hate them, too, but worse is knowing
<BR>How patiently for love you thirst,
<BR>While love my heart is overflowing.
<BR>Stone me, spill indecent spite
<BR>On my head for the many faults of man,
<BR>I'll patiently suffer, only come night
<BR>Let me be your one Tristan.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>SCULPTOR</H3>
<BR>Douse my eyes but grant me sculptor’s dreams
<BR>and hands to write the music of your head
<BR>in marble grained with such tall dignity
<BR>as swells your profile, throat to crown
<BR>silhouette of a Sforza, a Medici, bred
<BR>in the prideful north: arrogance of Italy.
<BR>Yet turning your face full to me you seem
<BR>a child whose fingers touch her dress
<BR>as she watches the schoolyard scattering
<BR>and hesitates, for fear of shattering
<BR>at any touch but a blind belov’d’s caress.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>VACATION</H3>
<BR>He took pleasure in his first job,
<BR>sweeping that beauty parlor floor.  He stole
<BR>fallen crescents of hair,
<BR>forced them in the dark inside his pillow.
<BR>Now he was grown and snapping
<BR>quick pictures of the Navajo girl’s dance.
<BR>Image eats soul, he knew the tribe's belief,
<BR>and he didn't even care
<BR>that if he had asked in a steady voice
<BR>his fingers might have held for a time
<BR>the exquisite embroidered weight of hair
<BR>she had woven down her braided spine.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>DREAMS</H3>
<BR>A passionate woman took all pleasure in me:
<BR>swam, arched and now dreams on my arm;
<BR>I watch her sleep smile and know
<BR>only you, only you, pale Atalanta,
<BR>how you outran the slow crave of arms,
<BR>and how you’d jab if I
<BR>held you, scorn attention, and I sigh
<BR>to change her pillow for your swift limbs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>ERRAND</H3>
<BR>She steps along the narrow
<BR>dune path.  Her errand halts to
<BR>watch gulls ride the cliff wind
<BR>up and up, a game so joyous,
<BR>a play so unlike a gull’s daily bicker
<BR>that she touches her throat to laugh.
<BR>The wind flames her hair just then,
<BR>the gull-bearing wind makes a belly in
<BR>her white dress.  Errand resumed, but
<BR>standing down the level shore,
<BR>mending stiff nets, dark-eyed
<BR>fisherman pauses now and follows
<BR>her shoulders with his own
<BR>brave, aching gaze.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>NATURAL HISTORY</H3>
<BR>That lobsterman out of Block Island swears
<BR>at horseshoe crabs, worthless as pigeons in his pots,
<BR>throws them on their backs to dry on the streaming deck,
<BR>legs kneading the air.  Not on my boat.
<BR>I pass them back with a small reverence,
<BR>earned, I think.  I met them first in solid stone
<BR>when I trawled the quarry for smooth plates of Connecticut shale
<BR>instead of the sea for a living.  There we hauled
<BR>the grandfathers of these
<BR>from rock two hundred million years deep.
<BR>And it made me think, we claw love and god but they know
<BR>the better trick: be ugly and inedible.
<BR>Amusing thought.  But the simple things
<BR>have watched the whole parade
<BR>of dinosaurs, heard the last beast’s dumb cry,
<BR>seen stars burn out and die
<BR>from beaches that have turned to stone.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>The FLEET</H3>
<BR>Athens gathering in splendor, might of a city
<BR>at last shorn of doubt and democracy, imperial burst:
<BR>hulls and spars, brine and oar-grease,
<BR>a matchless might.  A loud shout after solemn prayers.
<BR>All anchors up, trireme surge, dolphin-sport, out
<BR>to the headlands, to the bright horizon,
<BR>to distant Sicily, death, smoke, splinter,
<BR>and none returned but with eyes that stink prison.
<BR>
<BR>The rock slumbered in the tide,
<BR>not dreaming to rip anyone’s belly:
<BR>A black horse crossed its hot ridge
<BR>that night, wholly indifferent.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>BERLIN WALL</H3>
<BR>Tart German had a soft pastry glaze there.
<BR>“ish” for Prussian “Ich,” and the suburbs
<BR>lisped: Zehlendorf, Steglitz, Spandau.
<BR>
<BR>I met a woman on the train and we made love
<BR>in her brother’s flat
<BR>she had red hair
<BR>I dared not refuse and she had to show me
<BR>what to do.
<BR>
<BR>Uneasy at first, working, coupling, waking
<BR>behind a concrete blaze that said “Never
<BR>Touch Me.”  But in a week it seemed natural
<BR>to bicycle about, humming tunes and meet
<BR>the Cold War behind some trees,
<BR>where it zagged inconveniently down
<BR>alleys, through yards, tracing an old ward line.
<BR>
<BR>This year in Berlin
<BR>the wall came down.
<BR>People took
<BR>sledgehammers, punched holes, then walked
<BR>over and over through the narrow air of it.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>NEW VENUS</H3>
<BR>The delicate cover girl possesses
<BR>a careful consciousness of poise,
<BR>narrow shoulders, flaxen tresses,
<BR>belly flat as a hungry boy’s,
<BR>eyes -- not dull but hardly clever:
<BR>O my beloved, do you not see?
<BR>Ox-eyed Aphrodite never
<BR>could look thus or walk like she
<BR>or smile through such thin lips;
<BR>in the lustering eye that lights your face,
<BR>in voluptuous swimming of your hips,
<BR>in the dark jewel of your navel I trace
<BR>flesh the goddess of passion wore
<BR>to lure sea-heroes to a perilous shore.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>BELLY DANCER</H3>
<BR>Curved country, lulled and ripe the harvest,
<BR>of a hill full of sunshine, a pale billow
<BR>played along the clean beach, rippling flags,
<BR>hemmed to the floor, veiled to the eyes,
<BR>and all her solid, supple belly bared.
<BR>Bare feet beat on stones, wrists
<BR>twine and bend, breasts breathe,
<BR>and at spiral's end her belly-eye:
<BR>delicate yawn in a shudder of flesh,
<BR>idol-jewel of temples ruled by Cybele
<BR>moving to murmured tides of melodies
<BR>thrumming deep in restless, open she.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>CLOCK</H3>
<BR>When I was a boy the clock
<BR>by my bed lost its glass
<BR>face and spun naked brass-plate hands;
<BR>electric chatter
<BR>as I waited to sleep. The minute
<BR>hand stately striding lapped
<BR>the plump hour again and
<BR>again. He trotted, but she told
<BR>him "it's not a race" and friction
<BR>wore him down at every pass,
<BR>because there was more of her, you see;
<BR>and the second hand ran around and around
<BR>saying, "stop it, stop it," and they didn't
<BR>see him at all.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>MID-LIFE ADVICE</H3>
<BR>She has the sharp that leaves when a man loses
<BR>hair, muscle. Fix your heart to her,
<BR>penny on a railroad track. remember this game. Stand back
<BR>and watch horror twitch at the edge
<BR>of her eye. With a small thump steel
<BR>proves its temper. Pry your mangled copper
<BR>from the rail -- look, the profile
<BR>of a president, dim and long, a shadow in the dirt at dusk.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>SANCTUARY</H3>
<BR>We talk of loves gone in and out of fashion,
<BR>but I mute one name -- your friend's -- wary
<BR>you'd fear lest your words inspire hope,
<BR>and teach me some sly checkmate move
<BR>upon that woman. Yet lately you remind
<BR>me of that luckless passion;
<BR>I sidestep the blaze but find
<BR>you steer me to it: and my cement
<BR>to tomb away my wretched love
<BR>spalls at your words, and something slips
<BR>through your voice, folded in an envelope
<BR>scented with, almost, it seems to me, encouragement.
<BR>Then I learn how, banished from the lips,
<BR>heart claims my heedless ears for sanctuary.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>BEECH</H3>
<BR>Lithe heart, timid toward dark
<BR>complexities, knot and root,
<BR>when the wind bows my gray
<BR>leaves to touch your neck, you flick
<BR>light heels and skit away,
<BR>and when I lay a slight flower
<BR>at your ear you lash back a kick.
<BR>Easy, simple lads tempt you,
<BR>the hunter boys in the free sun;
<BR>go, get your destiny in their dangerous glade,
<BR>but know my dreaming half-self blossomed
<BR>when you gave your amber ring:
<BR>the gouge of a hoof's blade
<BR>stamped in silver bark.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>BLUES QUEEN</H3>
<BR>The rain yawns and a bad fan
<BR>chips Joplin’s headstone
<BR>for a tooth of marble.
<BR>Red milk crates squat in
<BR>parking slots, dam the grimy snow,
<BR>little kids give the finger and walk
<BR>Rotweilers.  Little violations,
<BR>black tires on the prowl cars.
<BR>
<BR>In the number streets I watch
<BR>what I see of you through windows
<BR>boarded plywood after I punched out
<BR>unbearable glass.  You're only going
<BR>for milk, bread, but you are the lie
<BR>I can’t stop telling myself.
