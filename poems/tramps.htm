<p>
Out of the mud two strangers came
<BR>And caught me splitting wood in the yard,
<BR>And one of them put me off my aim
<BR>By hailing cheerily "Hit them hard!"
<BR>I knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
<BR>And let the other go on a way.
<BR>I knew pretty well what he had in mind:
<BR>He wanted to take my job for pay.
<p>
Good blocks of oak it was I split,
<BR>As large around as the chopping block;
<BR>And every piece I squarely hit
<BR>Fell splinterless as a cloven rock.
<BR>The blows that a life of self-control
<BR>Spares to strike for the common good,
<BR>That day, giving a loose my soul,
<BR>I spent on the unimportant wood.
<p>
The sun was warm but the wind was chill.
<BR>You know how it is with an April day
<BR>When the sun is out and the wind is still,
<BR>You're one month on in the middle of May.
<BR>But if you so much as dare to speak,
<BR>A cloud comes over the sunlit arch,
<BR>A wind comes off a frozen peak,
<BR>And you're two months back in the middle of March.
<p>
A bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
<BR>And turns to the wind to unruffle a plume,
<BR>His song so pitched as not to excite
<BR>A single flower as yet to bloom.
<BR>It is snowing a flake; and he half knew
<BR>Winter was only playing possum.
<BR>Except in color he isn't blue,
<BR>But he wouldn't advise a thing to blossom.
<p>
The water for which we may have to look
<BR>In summertime with a witching wand,
<BR>In every wheelrut's now a brook,
<BR>In every print of a hoof a pond.
<BR>Be glad of water, but don't forget
<BR>The lurking frost in the earth beneath
<BR>That will steal forth after the sun is set
<BR>And show on the water its crystal teeth.
<p>
The time when most I loved my task
<BR>The two must make me love it more
<BR>By coming with what they came to ask.
<BR>You'd think I never had felt before
<BR>The weight of an ax-head poised aloft,
<BR>The grip of earth on outspread feet,
<BR>The life of muscles rocking soft
<BR>And smooth and moist in vernal heat.
<p>
Out of the wood two hulking tramps
<BR>(From sleeping God knows where last night,
<BR>But not long since in the lumber camps).
<BR>They thought all chopping was theirs of right.
<BR>Men of the woods and lumberjacks,
<BR>The judged me by their appropriate tool.
<BR>Except as a fellow handled an ax
<BR>They had no way of knowing a fool.
<p>
Nothing on either side was said.
<BR>They knew they had but to stay their stay
<BR>And all their logic would fill my head:
<BR>As that I had no right to play
<BR>With what was another man's work for gain.
<BR>My right might be love but theirs was need.
<BR>And where the two exist in twain
<BR>Theirs was the better right--agreed.
<p>
But yield who will to their separation,
<BR>My object in living is to unite
<BR>My avocation and my vocation
<BR>As my two eyes make one in sight.
<BR>Only where love and need are one,
<BR>And the work is play for mortal stakes,
<BR>Is the deed ever really done
<BR>For Heaven and the future's sakes.
