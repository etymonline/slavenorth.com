<p>
<br>And then went down to the ship,
<br>Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea, and
<br>We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,
<br>Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also
<br>Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward
<br>Bore us onward with bellying canvas,
<br>Crice's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
<br>Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,
<br>Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day's end.
<br>Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean,
<br>Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,
<br>To the Kimmerian lands, and peopled cities
<br>Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever
<br>With glitter of sun-rays
<br>Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven
<br>Swartest night stretched over wreteched men there.
<br>The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place
<br>Aforesaid by Circe.
<br>Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,
<br>And drawing sword from my hip
<br>I dug the ell-square pitkin;
<br>Poured we libations unto each the dead,
<br>First mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour
<br>Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads;
<br>As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best
<br>For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods,
<br>A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a bell-sheep.
<br>Dark blood flowed in the fosse,
<br>Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides
<br>Of youths and of the old who had borne much;
<br>Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender,
<br>Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,
<br>Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms,
<br>These many crowded about me; with shouting,
<br>Pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
<br>Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze;
<br>Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
<br>To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine;
<br>Unsheathed the narrow sword,
<br>I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,
<br>Till I should hear Tiresias.
<br>But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,
<br>Unburied, cast on the wide earth,
<br>Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
<br>Unwept, unwrapped in the sepulchre, since toils urged other.
<br>Pitiful spirit. And I cried in hurried speech:
<br>"Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?
<br>"Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?"
<br>                 And he in heavy speech:
<br>"Ill fate and abundant wine. I slept in Crice's ingle.
<br>"Going down the long ladder unguarded,
<br>"I fell against the buttress,
<br>"Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.
<br>"But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied,
<br>"Heap up mine arms, be tomb by sea-bord, and inscribed:
<br>"A man of no fortune, and with a name to come.
<br>"And set my oar up, that I swung mid fellows."
<br>
<br>And Anticlea came, whom I beat off, and then Tiresias Theban,
<br>Holding his golden wand, knew me, and spoke first:
<br>"A second time? why? man of ill star,
<br>"Facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?
<br>"Stand from the fosse, leave me my bloody bever
<br>"For soothsay."
<br>                 And I stepped back,
<br>And he strong with the blood, said then: "Odysseus
<br>"Shalt return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,
<br>"Lose all companions." Then Anticlea came.
<br>Lie quiet Divus. I mean, that is Andreas Divus,
<br>In officina Wecheli, 1538, out of Homer.
<br>And he sailed, by Sirens and thence outwards and away
<br>And unto Crice.
<br>                 Venerandam,
<br>In the Cretan's phrase, with the golden crown, Aphrodite,
<br>Cypri munimenta sortita est, mirthful, oricalchi, with golden
<br>Girdle and breat bands, thou with dark eyelids
<br>Bearing the golden bough of Argicidia. So that:
