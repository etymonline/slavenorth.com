<b><font face="verdana, arial" color="669999" size="3">ADAM'S CURSE</b></font><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">
<p>
<BR>WE sat together at one summer's end,
<BR>That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,
<BR>And you and I, and talked of poetry.
<BR>I said, "A line will take us hours maybe;
<BR>Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,
<BR>Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.
<BR>Better go down upon your marrow-bones
<BR>And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones
<BR>Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;
<BR>For to articulate sweet sounds together
<BR>Is to work harder than all these, and yet
<BR>Be thought an idler by the noisy set
<BR>Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen
<BR>The martyrs call the world.'
<BR>
<BR>                                             And thereupon
<BR>That beautiful mild woman for whose sake
<BR>There's many a one shall find out all heartache
<BR>On finding that her voice is sweet and low
<BR>Replied, "To be born woman is to know -
<BR>Although they do not talk of it at school -
<BR>That we must labour to be beautiful.'
<BR>
<BR>I said, "It's certain there is no fine thing
<BR>Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.
<BR>There have been lovers who thought love should be
<BR>So much compounded of high courtesy
<BR>That they would sigh and quote with learned looks
<BR>precedents out of beautiful old books;
<BR>Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'
<BR>
<BR>We sat grown quiet at the name of love;
<BR>We saw the last embers of daylight die,
<BR>And in the trembling blue-green of the sky
<BR>A moon, worn as if it had been a shell
<BR>Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell
<BR>About the stars and broke in days and years.
<BR>
<BR>I had a thought for no one's but your ears:
<BR>That you were beautiful, and that I strove
<BR>To love you in the old high way of love;
<BR>That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown
<BR>As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.
