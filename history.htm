<blockquote><b><i>"The historian's one task is to tell the thing as it happened. This he cannot do, if he is Artaxerxes's physician, trembling before him, or hoping to get a purple cloak, a golden chain, a horse of the Nisaean breed, in payment for his laudations. A fair historian, a Xenophon, a Thucydides, will not accept that position. He may nurse some private dislikes, but he will attach far more importance to the public good, and set the truth high above his hate; he may have his favorites, but he will not spare their errors. For history, I say again, has this and only this for its own; if a man will start upon it, he must sacrifice to no God but Truth; he must neglect all else; his sole rule and unerring guide is this -- to think not of those who are listening to him now, but of the yet unborn who shall seek his converse."</b></i> [Lucian (c.120-190 C.E.), <i>"The Way to Write History"</i>]
</blockquote>
History is not written in a vacuum. Historians are embedded in their surrounding culture, even though they are capable of questioning and even upending that culture's assumptions about itself.
<p>
Most U.S. historians are patriotic; that is, in common with most other people, they are personally committed to the places where they were born and raised. They want to see these places shed their problems and fulfill their potentials. Like Americans in general, though, they can differ wildly over what aspect of America fall into the categories of "problem" and "potential."
<p>
History itself is a subculture. In their student years, historians learn how to research. But they also read and parse the works of the then-dominant generation of historians. There are few deliberate ideologues among the chief historians in any era, but even those without such a motive sometimes feel an obligation to question the cultural assumptions that have nourished their trade.
<p>
This is especially true of topics that are full of social and political importance, yet are capable of a broad range of interpretations. That helps explain how the historical geniuses of one generation can hold views that the historical geniuses of the next reject. The discipline of history is not a mosaic to which each generation adds a chip, a shade.  It is a conversation carried on over generations. It is a place where whole paradigms of the past are thrown off and replaced by new ones, woven from the same data but with a different design.
<p>
The image of "shifting paradigms," of course, is from Thomas Kuhn's <b>"Structure of Scientific Revolutions."</b> But history shares this quality with the pure sciences. Stephen Jay Gould and his heirs among modern biologists fight so hard against anything that suggests genetic influence over social behavior because they remember, with shame, the nightmare of earlier scientists' seduction by social Darwinism. What Gould writes about science (in his introduction to <b><i>"The Mismeasure of Man"</i></b>) can be as well said of history:
<blockquote>
"... I believe that science must be understood as a social phenomenon, a gutsy, human enterprise, not the work of robots programmed to collect pure information. ... Science, since people must do it, is a socially embedded activity. It progresses by hunch, vision, and intuition. Much of its change through time does not record a closer approach to absolute truth, but the alteration of cultural contexts that influence it so strongly. Facts are not pure and unsullied bits of information; culture also influences what we see and how we see it. Theories, moreover, are not inexorable inductions from facts. The most creative theories are often imaginative visions imposed upon facts; the source of imagination is also strongly cultural."
</blockquote>
Gould himself, when he was alive, was accused of projecting onto his theories of evolutionary biology the Marxism he absorbed from his youth, and which he advocated throughout a life of consistent political activism in support of socialism and in opposition to colonialism and oppression.
<p>
The scholarly tendency to overlook Northern slavery, or to shunt it into footnotes, is perhaps an outgrowth of social forces. First, the need to justify the North's war, the terrible deeds done in the name of Union, sanctified by abolitionist rhetoric. If the North had slavery on its hands, that taints the project. Then, in the post-Civil Rights era, the desire to find a continuity of heroic crusaders for race throughout the nation's history. A conviction of freedom riders, but also a desperate need to knit together a country that seepmed ready to come unseamed as at no time since the Civil War itself, with race riots lighting the skies over cities in all regions.
<p>
"Scholars now show a greater willingness to accept the possibility of nonuniformity of behavior by masters and slaves, as well as variability in individual behavior reflecting different economic, demographic, and other conditions. Generalizations may be useful for moral arguments, however, and that is why historical generalization often seems to be preferred in the discussion of slavery." Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman, "Changing Views of Slavery in the United States South."
<p>
"Although most slaves in human history no doubt gravitated toward the bottom of such a scale [of rights, powers, and privileges], the spectrum of slave conditions clearly overlaps a larger spectrum that includes all varieties of oppression and powerlessness. Thus some forms of contract labor, though technically free, would score lower on the larger spectrumthan many ystemsof conventional bondage. For example, Chinese 'coolies' who were transportedin the mid-ninteenth century across the Pacific to the coast of Peru died in appalling numbers from the lethal effects of mining and shoveling seabird excrement for the world's fertilizer market." David Brion Davis, "The Problem of Slavery"
<p>
As for the authors of the Constitution, North and South, they had the example of the ancient societies they emulated, as well as the Enlightenment thinkers who educated them, for the paradoxical connection between free people and slave labor.
<p>
John Locke, who formulated the theory of natural liberty, invested in the Royal African Company (the organization that held British monopoly of the slave trade), and he wrote a provision for slavery into his draft of the "Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina." [F&E, p.31]
<p>
Rousseau, in his section on "Deputies or Representatives" in "The Social Contract," has a penetrating digression on slavery and democracy:
<blockquote> 
Among the Greeks, all that the people had to do, it did itself; it was continuously assembled in the market place. The Greek people lived in a mild climate; it was not at all avaricious; slaves did the work; its chief concern was freedom. Without the same advantages, how can the same rights be preserved? Your harsher climates create more necessities; six months of the year the public places are uninhabitable; your muted tongues cannot make themselves heard in the open air; you care more for your profits than your freedom; and you fear slavery less than you fear poverty. What? Is freedom to be maintained only with the support of slavery? Perhaps. The two extremes meet. Everything outside nature has its disadvantages, civil society more than all the rest. There are some situations so unfortunate that one can preserve one's freedom only at the expense of the freedom of someone else; and the citizen can be perfectly free only if the slave is absolutely a slave. Such was the situation of Sparta. You peoples of the modern world, you have no slaves, but you are slaves yourselves; you pay for their liberty with your own. It is in vain that you boast of this preference; I see more cowardice than humanity in it. I do not mean by all this to suggest that slaves are necessary or that the right of slavery is legitimate, for I have proved the contrary. I simply state the reasons why peoples of the modern world, believing themselves to be free, have representatives, and why peoples of the ancient world did not.
</blockquote>

<p>
A while back, I must have been in the mood to get fired, because I took up my editor's suggestion and started digging around in the morgue of the Lancaster newspaper where I work, looking for old issues from the slavery days, to find what I knew would be there: advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves, or announcing the impending sale of slaves in Maryland and Virginia, or notices placed by the local sheriff of suspected runaways who had been taken into custody.
<p>
I knew they would be there because I had seen them in plenty in West Chester during my research there. In fact, you could find them in any northern newspaper in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Very few of those papers are still around, but my employer is one of them. Its ancestors are the <i>"Lancaster Journal,"</i> founded in 1794, and the <i>"Lancaster Intelligencer & Weekly Advertiser,"</i> which began publication in 1799.
<p>
It took me about 15 minutes on the microfilm machine to find examples of all three types of advertising I was looking for. Both the <i>"Journal"</i> and the <i>"Intelligencer"</i> included almost from their inception advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves. On Oct. 5, 1799, the <i>"Intelligencer"</i> carried an ad placed by a man in Augusta County, Va., offering $30 for a mulatto named Oliver, about 28 years old. "He speaks very quick, is active as a waiter, and well acquainted with farming."
<p>
On Nov. 4, 1796, the <i>"Journal"</i> featured 19 advertisements on its front page. Among the farms for sale and notices of elections are two for what are likely runaway slaves, as well as two for indentured servants and one for a runaway apprentice. Rewards for two more slaves and another servant are printed inside.
<p>
Rewards offered ran as little as 1 cent, rarely more than $10. A stolen horse carried a $20 award. One farmer offered $40 for the return of a stolen hive of bees.
<p>
These newspapers, and their owners, profited from slavery through these ads. Ads in the <i>"Journal"</i> cost $1 for three printings of an ad of "one square" -- a square inch -- greater length increasing in cost in proportion. Most of the slave ads were one or two squares long, but some were three or more.
<p>
Many of the ads for runaways were from northern states. Usually the ads dealt with runaways who had fled from owners in Lancaster or one of its neighboring counties.
<p>
From 1796: Under the headline "TWENTY DOLLARS REWARD," "Ran away from Cornwall Furnace, Dauphin County, on Sunday the 17th of April last, a Negro Man, called Dick (alias) Governor Dick: he is an elderly man, bald headed, about five feet ten inches high, stout made, has a down look, is slightly marked on each of his temples with the small scores usual to some of the natives of Africa. ... He is by trade a rough carpenter, and values himself greatly on his dexterity in that occupation. ... Whoever secures the said Negro so that the owners may get him again, shall receive the above reward, and reasonable charges, if brought home." [Dauphin County is where Harrisburg, Pa., is.]
<p>
There were so many that I only jotted down a few examples:
<p>
Aug. 5, 1796, Matthias Slough of Lancaster advertised for the return of a runaway mulatto man named George and George's pregnant wife. ... from 1808, $5 reward and "reasonable expenses" for return of a lame slave named Isaac Scipio, offered by Peter Dinkle of York, Pa. ... 1809, $50 reward for Jack, 48, his daughter Grace, 18, and a mulatto girl friend of Grace's who had run off from Monmouth County, N.J. ... June 2, 1809, a couple and their two young children, one still nursing, from New Jersey. $40 reward.
<p>
And if slaves were not actually sold in Pennsylvania after 1780, they certainly were advertised for sale. In December 1809, the Lancaster newspapers carried advertisements for 2,000 acres and 25 slaves, the estate of a judge in Loudon County, Va. "The negroes are supposed to be very valuable, some of them being good house servants, and the others principally young men and women."
<p>
But the best discovery, I thought, was that the founder of the clan that still owns the newspaper owned two slaves in the 1830 census.
<p>
Needless to say, this story never got written.
